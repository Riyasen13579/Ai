  Overview of the technologies and libraries used.
2. Features
  Speech Recognition: Convert spoken commands into text.
  Text-to-Speech (TTS): Respond to commands and queries with voice.
  Command Execution: Execute tasks like opening websites or performing system tasks.
  Customization: Easily add new commands or extend functionality.
3. Technologies and Libraries
  List and explain the core technologies and libraries used in the project:
  SpeechRecognition (for speech-to-text)
  pyttsx3 (for text-to-speech)
  pyaudio (for microphone input)
  Optional: any other libraries for extended functionality (e.g., requests, schedule).
